# vocabrary_teacher-
vocabrary_teacher  in android


This project is an implementation of an idea I had about how to improve the
vocabulary when learning new languages. I have encountered a problem in which
I learned a lot of new words in the new language, but I didn't have any
automatic platform to register them to and learn them.

I had many sources of words to learn from (books, TV, internet...), but I wanted
to have some kind of program that will help me keep track of the words that
I have learned, and help me learn the new ones that I encounter with.

This idea has created the **VocabularyTeacher**. The purpose of this project is
to help the user learn new words in a new language, just like a teacher might
do.

This project will have a lot of different implementation for this same project,
written for different platforms (or in different languages), but all of those
implementation will have the same idea in mind and will work around it.
